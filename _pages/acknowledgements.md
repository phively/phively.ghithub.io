This site is built using Jekyll, and makes liberal use of several different code bases. Here are the most significant.

## About Poole

The site's layout, styles, and navigation pane were forked from Mark Otto's Poole and Hyde themes. Here's his description as of April 17, 2016:

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Michael Lanyon's blog

Michael Lanyon's blog has [a great tutorial](https://blog.lanyonm.org/articles/2013/11/21/alphabetize-jekyll-page-tags-pure-liquid.html) on GitHub-Pages-friendly Liquid scripting. I used these ideas extensively throughout.
