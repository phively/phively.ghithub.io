This site is built using Jekyll, and makes liberal use of several different code bases. Here are the most significant.

## About Poole

The site's layout, styles, and navigation pane were forked from Mark Otto's Poole and Hyde themes. Here's his description as of April 17, 2016:

> In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
> 
> There are currently two themes built on Poole:
> 
> * [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
> * [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
> 
> Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).
> 
> #### Setup

## Other GitHub Pages blogs

Michael Lanyon's blog has [a great tutorial](https://blog.lanyonm.org/articles/2013/11/21/alphabetize-jekyll-page-tags-pure-liquid.html) on GitHub-Pages-friendly Liquid scripting. I used these ideas extensively throughout.

The [Nice Blog](http://benjaminblog.ml/Nice_Blog/) layout has some good minimalist ideas and elegant coding.

I didn't use [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) to initialize my blog, but I do really like their icons! These appear at the bottom of the nav bar.

## LaTeX

I implemented LaTeX rendering using MathJax as described [here](http://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/) by Haixing Hu. There was some messiness with inline equations but after tweaking the code he provided it works great.
